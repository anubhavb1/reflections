What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary area, which offers flexibility to the user regarding what all they want to add in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We can add the changed files to the staging area before committing them. Hence, if a logical change involves more than one file, we add the required files to the staging area, check to make sure, and then commit them.
