How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 

Well, easy access to the entire history of a file would give me access easily incase of an error. Like for example due to some reasons, the file fails to work. I could go and look up a last working version of it, and change it to that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 

Pros:
meaningful commits
more freedom and flexibility

Cons:
If user is not careful, might lead to heavy and difficult-to-understand commits
User has to keep in mind to regularly commit  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log can be used to list the commits of the repository, where as git diff is used to see the changes between two commits.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

One need not worry about breaking something as a version control would contain a working commit prior to that. Thus, it allows the developers to be braver and try out new things without worrying about breaking their current work.
